# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:


• Use the Rails framework
• You need at least 3 models including a join model to set up a has_many, through relationship
	○ One model must be your user
	○ Your join model MUST have a user-submittable attribute
• Reasonable validations
	○ MUST validate uniqueness of user login
	○ Validation anything else that makes sense for your application
• You must include at least one class level ActiveRecord scope method
	○ Must be chainable, meaning that you must use ActiveRecord Query methods within it (such as .where and .order) rather than native ruby methods (such as #find_all or #sort)
• Your application must be, within reason, a DRY (Do-Not-Repeat-Yourself) rails app
You should define helper methods in the appropriate place
